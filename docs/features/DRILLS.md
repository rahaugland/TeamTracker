# Drill Library

Complete guide to creating, managing, and using volleyball drills in TeamTracker.

## Overview

The Drill Library is a comprehensive database of volleyball practice exercises. Build your personal collection of drills with skill tags, progression levels, and execution tracking to plan effective practices and develop players systematically.

## Key Concepts

### What is a Drill?

A **drill** is a practice exercise or activity designed to develop specific volleyball skills.

**Components:**

- Player requirements (min/max)
- Equipment needed
- Estimated duration
- Optional video demonstration

### System vs. Custom Drills

**System Drills:**
- Pre-loaded by TeamTracker
- Common volleyball exercises
- Cannot be deleted
- Can be duplicated and customized

**Custom Drills:**
- Created by coaches
- Team-specific variations
- Fully editable
- Can be shared or kept private

### Drill Progressions

Link drills in progression chains from beginner to advanced:

**Example progression:**
1. Level 1: Partner passing (static)
2. Level 2: Partner passing (with movement)
